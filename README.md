This is the Knights Travails project from TOP's curriculum. Given an 8x8 board, a knight, a starting and a finishing point, it finds the shortest path from start to finish and outputs the steps taken. It utilizes a graph whose vertices are board's cells and each vertex's edges are the knight's possible moves from that point The algorithm used to find the shortest path is the breadth-first search algorithm (BFS).
